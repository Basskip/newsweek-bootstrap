# Building With Responsive Design

A project from [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/using-bootstrap) curriculum, copying the design of Newsweek's homepage to learn Bootstrap

## Things I learned
* The basics of Bootstrap 4.4

## Things to work on
* Searchbar isn't styled correctly
* Some images missing
* Missing some :hover effects
